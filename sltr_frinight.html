    <h3>"Trust and Obey"</h3>
    <p>When we walk with the Lord 
In the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey.

    <i>Trust and obey
    For there’s no other way
    To be happy in Jesus
    But to trust and obey.</i>

Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear
Not a sigh or a tear
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet 
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.
    </p>

    <h3>"Presence, Power, Glory" by Citipointe Live</h3>
    <p>Strip me back of 
All my pride, my possessions
'Til all I want and all I seek 
Is Your presence

Awake in me
A fire and a zeal
A fire full of love
Heaven open up

    <i>So come and fill this place
    With Your mercy, with Your grace
    Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
    With power and with love
    All consuming fire come
    Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit</i>

We want more of Your presence
We want more of Your power
We want more of Your glory
We want to know You
    </p>

    <h3>"Look How He Lifted Me" by Elevation Worship</h3>
    <p>My world was shaken
My heart was broken
My hope was fading
The walls were closing in
But now I'm singing
Look how He lifted me

My life was sinking
My days were numbered
The waves were crashing
The flood was coming in
Oh Hallelujah
Look how He lifted me

    <i>Look how He lifted me
    His grace and mercy
    Is my testimony
    For every victory
    I've got a song to sing
    Look how He lifted me!</i>

He turned my mourning
Back into dancing
He turned my weeping
Into a shout again
And now I'm singing
Look how He lifted me

He rolled my sorrows 
Away at calvary
He rose in triumph 
Over the enemy
Oh Hallelujah
Look how he lifted me

    <i>When nothing else could help
    Your love came down
    Your love came down
    When nothing else could help
    Your love came down
    And lifted me</i>
    </p>
