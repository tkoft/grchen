SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Psalm 95:1-7</b>
“Oh come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
<b>Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!</b>
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
<b>In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.</b>
The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!
<b>For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.”</b>
Let us worship the Lord together!

TITLE: 10,000 Reasons
ARTIST: Matt Redman

The sun comes up
It’s a new day dawning
It’s time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes

CHORUS:
Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I’ll worship Your Holy name

You’re rich in love
And You’re slow to anger
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore


TITLE: When I Think About the Lord
ARTIST: Shane & Shane

When I think about the Lord
How He saved me how He raised me
How He filled me with the Holy Ghost
How He healed me to the uttermost

When I think about the Lord
How He picked me up and turned me around
How He placed my feet on solid ground
It makes me wanna shout

CHORUS:
Hallelujah thank You Jesus
Lord You're worthy of all the glory
And all the honor and all the praise


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>Holy and merciful God, in your presence we confess our sinfulness, our shortcomings, and our offenses against you. You alone know how often we have sinned in wandering from your ways, in wasting your gifts, in forgetting your love. Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we are ashamed and sorry for all we have done to displease you. Forgive our sins, and help us to live in your light and walk in your ways, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.</b>

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>2 Corinthians 4:5-6</b>
"What we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, ... for God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” <b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Algeria, Week 1: Intro</b>
Algeria is geographically the largest country in Africa, bordering the Mediterranean sea on the north where most of the population resides, and overlapping the Sahara desert to the South, which makes up about 80% of the country’s terrain. It has been influenced by many empires and peoples - Roman, Ottoman, Arab, Spanish - impacting the ways of culture and society. It experienced a bloody war of independence with France in 1962, and then a civil war in the 1990s that cost many lives and left more traumatized. It still faces political unrest and tension, especially with changes being made by the current president who came into office at the end of 2019, following the forced resignation after a 20 year rule of the previous president. Many people are skeptical of political promises for reform, and have been angered by the arrest of journalists and tightening control of society
<ul>
    <li>Pray for the peace and the welfare of Algeria</li>
    <li>Pray for leaders to have integrity and wisdom, to not strive for power and control, and to represent the people fairly</li>
    <li>Pray for political unrest and dissatisfaction to turn people to the only One that can bring true peace, justice, and restoration, Jesus Christ</li>
</ul>


TITLE: Good and Gracious King
ARTIST: CityAlight

I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King

I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise

CHORUS:
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You're a good and gracious King

O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again

BRIDGE:
Holy holy Lord Almighty
Good and gracious
Good and gracious
Holy holy Lord Almighty
Good and gracious King


TITLE: King of Kings
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

In the darkness, we were waiting
Without hope, without light
'Til from Heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

CHORUS:
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died

And the morning that You rose
All of Heaven held its breath
'Til that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored

And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me, ohh


SECTION: Commission & Benediction
