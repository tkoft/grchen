TITLE: O Come to the Altar
ARTIST: Elevation Worship

Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself?
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling

CHORUS:
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today, there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes, a new life is born
Jesus is calling

BRIDGE:
Oh what a Savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen

Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you've found


TITLE: Abide With Me
ARTIST: Henry Francis Lyte, William Henry Monk

Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
Oh You who changes not, abide with me.

I need Your presence every passing hour:
What but Your grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like Yourself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with You at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, your victory?
I triumph still, if You abide with me.


TITLE: No Longer Slaves
ARTIST: Bethel Music

You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

CHORUS:
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins

BRIDGE:
You split the sea so I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me and I will stand and sing
I am a child of God

BRIDGE:
Once dead in sin but now alive in Jesus
Redeemed from slavery by His blood
You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God


TITLE: More Like Jesus
ARTIST: Kristian Stanfill

You came to the world you created
Trading your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost

Counting your status as nothing,
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with your love

CHORUS:
If more of You means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You is all I need
Take everything

You are my life and my treasure
The one that I can't live without
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down

BRIDGE:
Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my hearts in your hands
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus
This world
Is dying to know who You are
You've shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus


TITLE: The Lion and the Lamb
ARTIST: Bethel Music

He's coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms will bow down
And every chain will break
As broken hearts declare His praise
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

CHORUS:
Our God is the lion
The Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power
And fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before Him

CHORUS:
Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
Every knee will bow before Him

So open up the gates
Make way before the King of Kings
The God who comes to save
Is here to set the captives free
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

BRIDGE:
For who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
