<b>Bangladesh, Week 1: News & Events</b>
Like every nation, Bangladesh has been hit hard with the Covid pandemic and has struggled to manage, especially with a healthcare system that was already insufficient to care for much of the country’s existing needs. Closure of factories and other attempts at slowing transmission has resulted in high rates of unemployment causing other concerns such as hunger - food more desperately needed than soap, masks, or other health safety. In addition to the pandemic, Bangladesh has been overwhelmed with flooding; the past two years have seen the most intense rainfall in decades. Bangladesh yearly experiences heavy monsoon flooding that destroys much of its infrastructure, but this year has been more challenging as people struggle to find shelter and are much more vulnerable to all sorts of diseases along with Covid. Some people see little difference between dying of starvation and dying from the virus, the best thing available to many are their prayers. Bangladeshi’s have lost much this year.

SECTION: Invitation to the Lord's Supper
This Supper proclaims the death of our Lord Jesus until he comes again in glory, when he will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more.
<b>It points to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, where we shall be the bride of Christ--all those who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</b>

SECTION: Commemoration
Therefore we proclaim our faith as signified and sealed in this sacrament: <b>Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again.</b>
