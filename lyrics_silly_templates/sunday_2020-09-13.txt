TITLE: O My Soul Arise
ARTIST: Soverign Grace Music

Arise my soul arise shake off your guilty fears
The bleeding sacrifice on my behalf appears
Before the throne my surety stands
Before the throne my surety stands
My name is written on His hands

He ever lives above for me to intercede
His all redeeming love His precious blood to plead
His blood atoned for every race
His blood atoned for every race
And sprinkles now the throne of grace

CHORUS:
O my soul arise behold the risen Christ
Your great high priest your spotless sacrifice
O my soul arise God owns you as His child
Shake off your guilty fears my soul arise

Five bleeding wounds He bears received on Calvary
They pour effectual prayers they strongly plead for me
Forgive him O forgive they cry
Forgive him O forgive they cry
Don’t let that ransomed sinner die

My God is reconciled His pard’ning voice I hear
He owns me as His child I can no longer fear
With confidence I now draw nigh
With confidence I now draw nigh
And Father Abba Father cry

TITLE: Nothing But The Blood
ARTIST: Public Domain

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

CHORUS:
O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this me plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>Gracious Father, you sent your Son to die and rise to new life in order that death might be brought to an end and that we might live a new life in Him. Yet we confess that we too often have chosen to remain captive to doubt and fear and ways that lead to death. By our thoughts, words, and actions, we have scorned your love, diminished the lives of others, and defaced your image in us. Father, forgive us for Jesus’ sake, and enable us by His resurrection power to live no longer for ourselves but for Him who died and rose again for us. Amen.</b>

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>Romans 5:8; Colossians 1:13-14; Romans 5:1</b>
God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Algeria, Week 2: People & Religion</b>
Algeria has a population of almost 44 million. Northern Africa is predominantly inhabited overall by Arab-Muslims today, but it used to be primarily populated by the Berber people, who make up the original inhabitants of Algeria, and of whom most Algerians can trace descent. Berbers were Christian until around the 6th century when Arab Muslims invaded and immigrated across Northern Africa eventually forcing conversion to Islam. All Berber ethnic groups identify Islam as their religion, but often relate more with their cultural heritage and traditions than with the teachings of the Koran. Islam makes up 96.8% of religion in the total population.
There are 6 million Kabyle Berbers, an ethnic group of Berber people, living mainly in the coastal mountain region of Algeria. Although they are still 99% Muslim, the Spirit has been working among them, and thousands have been coming to Christ in recent years.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for Algerian people who take pride in their heritage to learn and explore the history of where they have come from and to become curious about Jesus Christ</li>
    <li>Pray for Kabyle Berbers to continue coming to Christ and sharing Christ with their own people, despite opposition from authorities and others</li>
</ul>


TITLE: Only a Holy God
ARTIST: CityAlight

Who else commands all the host of heaven
Who else could make every king bow down
Who else can whisper and darkness tremble
Only a Holy God

What other beauty demands such praises
What other splendor outshines the sun
What other majesty rules with justice
Only a Holy God

CHORUS:
Come and behold Him, the One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

What other glory consumes like fire
What other power can raise the dead
What other name remains undefeated
Only a Holy God

Who else could rescue me from my failing
Who else would offer His only Son
Who else invites me to call Him Father
Only a Holy God
Only a Holy God


TITLE: Man of Sorrows
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

Man of sorrows Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father’s will
He took a crown of thorns

CHORUS:
Oh that rugged cross my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out hallelujah
Praise and honor unto Thee

Sent of heaven God’s own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

BRIDGE:
Now my debt is paid it is paid in full
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free oh is free indeed

See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised
He’s risen from the grave


SECTION: Commission & Benediction
<b>2 Corinthians 13:14</b>
“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.”
