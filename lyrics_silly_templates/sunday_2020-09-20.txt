SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Psalm 9:1-2, 7-11</b>
I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds. I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
<b>The LORD sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice, and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness.</b>
The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
<b>And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</b>
Let us sing praises to the LORD!

TITLE: Only a Holy God
ARTIST: CityAlight

Who else commands all the host of heaven
Who else could make every king bow down
Who else can whisper and darkness tremble
Only a Holy God

What other beauty demands such praises
What other splendor outshines the sun
What other majesty rules with justice
Only a Holy God

CHORUS:
Come and behold Him, the One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

What other glory consumes like fire
What other power can raise the dead
What other name remains undefeated
Only a Holy God

Who else could rescue me from my failing
Who else would offer His only Son
Who else invites me to call Him Father
Only a Holy God
Only a Holy God


TITLE: From Whom All Blessings Flow (Doxology)
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

What gift of love could I offer to a King
What weight or worth could be held within my offering
When He alone is worthy

A glory song is inscribed upon my heart
This treasure held in an alabaster jar I break
To bring Him all the glory

CHORUS:
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below

What sacrifice could be equal to His own
The cross of Christ has declared that there is nought I owe
Yet I know I owe Him all

CHORUS:
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise God from whom all blessings flow

BRIDGE:
Our Father God, the infinite
The matchless King, magnificent
The living Christ, the servant Son
The prophesied, the saving One
The Holy Ghost, gift from above
The faithful Friend, the seal of love
This life, this heart
This song to Him
My all in all, my everything

CHORUS:
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>Merciful Lord, pardon all our sins of omission and commission, of sullen, peevish, and angry tempers, of lip, life and walk, of hard-heartedness, unbelief, presumption, pride, of unfaithfulness to the souls of men, of lack of bold decision in the cause of Christ, of deficiency in outspoken zeal for His glory, of deception, injustice, untruthfulness in our dealings with others, of impurity in thought, word and deed, of covetousness, which is idolatry, of substance unduly hoarded, unwisely squandered, not consecrated to Your glory. Pardon all our sins, known and unknown, felt and unfelt, confessed and not confessed, remembered or forgotten. Good Lord, hear; and hearing, forgive.</b>
“Sins” (adapted from The Valley of Vision, pp. 158-159)

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>Psalm 103:8-14</b>
"The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.”
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Algeria, Week 3: Church</b>
Persecution has been rising in Algeria against Christians so that it has become the 17th country with the most intense persecution in the world in 2020. The government has actively been shutting down churches in the past year, sometimes interrupting meetings and harshly treating those present. It is very difficult for a believer from a Muslim background to be open about their faith because they will face harassment and discrimination from family and their community. Blasphemy against Islam and conversion of Muslims to Christianity is illegal, among other things, which means believers must be very careful who to trust and what to say. Despite these things, many people have been coming to faith through social media, radio, TV, and dreams and visions. Often, when an Algerian becomes a Christian, they think they are the only believers in Algeria because Christianity and Christian community is so suppressed. There are only an estimated 100,000 believers in Algeria.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for endurance for believers, as well as wisdom and courage to know how to live as witnesses of Jesus Christ</li>
    <li>Pray for isolated believers to find Christian communities, and for God to raise up many strong churches</li>
    <li>Pray for freedom of religion in Algeria, and that current political unrest would lead to changes in religious regulations</li>
</ul>


TITLE: 10,000 Reasons
ARTIST: Matt Redman

The sun comes up
It’s a new day dawning
It’s time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes

CHORUS:
Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I’ll worship Your Holy name

You’re rich in love
And You’re slow to anger
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore


TITLE: Behold Our God
ARTIST: Soverign Grace Music

Who has held the oceans in his hands?
Who has numbered every grain of sand?
Kings and nations tremble at his voice
All creation rises to rejoice

CHORUS:
Behold our God, seated on his throne
Come, let us adore him
Behold our king, nothing can compare
Come, let us adore him

Who has given counsel to the Lord?
Who can question any of his words?
Who can teach, the one who knows all things?
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

Who has felt the nails upon his hands?
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
God eternal, humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign

BRIDGE:
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
You will reign forever (let Your glory fill the Earth)
