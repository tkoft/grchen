SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Deuteronomy 6:4-6, 12-15</b>
“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
<b>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart...</b>
Take care lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
<b>It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.</b>
You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you—-
<b>for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God”</b>
Let us worship together!


TITLE: I Give Myself Away
ARTIST: William McDowell

I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me


TITLE: Here I Am to Worship
ARTIST: Michael W. Smith

Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

CHORUS:
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor


TITLE: His Mercy Is More
ARTIST: Keith & Kristyn Getty

What love could remember no wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all knowing, He counts not their sum
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

CHORUS:
Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness, new every morn
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What patience would wait as we constantly roam
What Father, so tender, is calling us home
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What riches of kindness He lavished on us
His blood was the payment, His life was the cost
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>O Living God, our sin is to look on our faults and be discouraged, or to look on our good and be puffed up. We fall short of your glory every day by spending hours unprofitably, by thinking that the things we do are good, when they are not done to your end, nor spring from the rules of your Word.</b>
<b>Our sin is to fear people instead of you; We forget to submit to your will, and fail to be quiet there. Help us to see that although we are in the wilderness it is not all briars and barrenness. We have bread from heaven, streams from the rock, light by day, fire by night, your dwelling place and your mercy seat.</b>
<b>We are sometimes discouraged by the way, but though winding and trying, it is safe and short; Death dismays us, but our great high priest stands in its waters, and will open us a passage, and beyond is a better country. While we live let our lives be exemplary. When we die may our end be peace.</b>
(Adapted from “Shortcomings,” The Valley of Vision, pp. 154-155)

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>John 3:16-17</b>
“God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life. Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.”
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

TITLE: My Worth Is Not In What I Own
ARTIST: Keith Getty

My worth is not in what I own
Not in the strength of flesh and bone
But in the costly wounds of love
At the cross

My worth is not in skill or name
In win or lose, in pride or shame
But in the blood of Christ that flowed
At the cross

CHORUS:
I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other
My soul is satisfied in Him alone

As summer flowers we fade and die
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by
But life eternal calls to us
At the cross

I will not boast in wealth or might
Or human wisdom's fleeting light
But I will boast in knowing Christ
At the cross

BRIDGE:
Two wonders here that I confess
My worth and my unworthiness
My value fixed, my ransom paid
At the cross


TITLE: Crowns
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

There is a hill I cherish
Where stood a precious tree
The emblem of Salvation
The gift of Calvary

How is it I should profit?
While He is crucified
Yet as His life was taken
So I was granted mine

CHORUS:
My wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross

I will not boast in riches
I have no pride in gold
But I will boast in Jesus
And in His Name alone

BRIDGE:
And when I stand in glory
My crowns before the Lord
Let this be my confession
My wealth is in the cross


SECTION: Commission & Benediction
