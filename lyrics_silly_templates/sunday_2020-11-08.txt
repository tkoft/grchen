Sunday Corporate Worship 2020-11-08

SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Psalm 133-134</b>
“Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!
<b>It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes!</b>
It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore.
<b>Come, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, who stand by night in the house of the LORD!</b>
Lift up your hands to the holy place and bless the LORD!
<b>May the LORD bless you from Zion, he who made heaven and earth!”</b>
Let us worship together!


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>O Lord, we bless You that those who turn aside may return to You immediately, and be welcomed without anything to commend them, notwithstanding all their former backsliding. We confess that this is suited to our case, for we did not come to the fountain that purges away all sin; we have labored too much for spiritual life, peace of conscience, progressive holiness, in our own strength.</b><br>
<b>We beg You, show us the arm of all might; help us to believe that You can do for us more than we ask or think, and that, though we backslide, Your love will never let us go, but will draw us back to You with everlasting cords. Keep us solemn, devout, faithful, resting on free grace for assistance, acceptance, and peace of conscience.</b><br>
“Backsliding” (adapted from The Valley of Vision, pp. 156-157)

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>1 Thessalonians 5:9-11</b>
"God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.”
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

</ul>

<b>East Cambridge & Greater Boston</b>
<ul>
    <li>That God would help us to make real, deep connections with our neighbors, doing the hard work of relationship-building for the Lord’s sake</li>
    <li>That God would have mercy upon our city in the midst of a COVID surge, providing for both our health and financial needs</li>

<b>China, Week 2: The Church</b>

<i>Philippians 2:3-6: “In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion”</i><br>
This week we are praying for the church in China. Pressure has been building. In the past the church experienced persecution and overcame as a faithful witness. This time tension is rising in a different way. Enforcement of existing religious policies and the addition of new policies has tightened restrictions on social media, internet use, and NGOs throughout the whole country. The online sale of Bibles was banned in 2018, and churches are being closely monitored with surveillance. Registered and unregistered, Catholic and protestant, churches are under pressure to conform to prevailing ideology or face potential closure. Because of this pressure, the church in China has risen to 23rd on the World Watch List of church persecution. Christianity is often seen as a Western power move intending to subvert China instead of a truly Chinese religion.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for believers, especially pastors and spiritual leaders facing real and heavy pressure, to be wise and humble in action, steadfast in prayer, speaking the Word with continued
boldness</li>
    <li>Pray for the church to conform to the teachings of the Bible, not prevailing ideologies - whether Government or Western - and to usher in the kingdom of God as leading examples among world believers</li>
    <li>Pray against division in the church with the pressure, but instead for unity, especially with the Three-Self Church and house churches</li>
</ul>


SECTION: Invitation to the Lord's Supper
Christ calls the bread his body and the cup his blood, or the new covenant in his blood. He wants to teach us that just as bread and wine nourish the temporal life, so too his crucified body and poured-out blood are the true food and drink of our souls for eternal life.
<b>But more important, he wants to assure us, by this visible sign and pledge, that we, through the Holy Spirit’s work, share in his true body and blood as surely as our mouths receive these holy signs in his remembrance, and that all of his suffering and obedience are as definitely ours as if we personally had suffered and made satisfaction for our sins.</b>

(Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 79)
John 6:51, 55; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 11:26; Rom. 6:5-11


SECTION: Commemoration
According to his commandment:
<b>
We remember his death.
We proclaim his resurrection.
We await his coming in glory.
</b>


TITLE: Jesus We Love You
ARTIST: Bethel Music

Old things have passed away
Your love has stayed the same
Your constant grace remains the cornerstone

Things that we thought were dead
Are breathing in life again
You cause your Son to shine on darkest nights

For all that you've done, we will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song

CHORUS:
Jesus we love you
Oh how we love you
You are the one our, our hearts adore

The hopeless have found their hope
The orphans now have a home
All that was lost has found its place in you

You lift our weary head
You make us strong instead
You took these rags and made us beautiful

For all that you've done, we will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song

BRIDGE:
Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus
Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus


TITLE: More Like Jesus
ARTIST: Passion

You came to the world you created
Trading your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost

Counting your status as nothing,
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with your love

CHORUS:
If more of You means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You is all I need
Take everything

You are my life and my treasure
The one that I can't live without
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down

BRIDGE:
Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my hearts in your hands
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus

BRIDGE:
This world
Is dying to know who You are
You've shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus


TITLE: Yet Not I but Through Christ in Me
ARTIST: CityAlight

What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace

CHORUS:
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed

CHORUS:
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave

CHORUS:
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne

CHORUS:
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
