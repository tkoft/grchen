Wednesday Night Prayer 3/11/2020

TITLE: Abide With Me
ARTIST: Henry Francis Lyte, William Henry Monk

Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
Oh You who changes not, abide with me.

I need Your presence every passing hour:
What but Your grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like Yourself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with You at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, your victory?
I triumph still, if You abide with me.


TITLE: Mercy
ARTIST: Matt Redman

I will kneel in the dust
At the foot of the cross
Where mercy paid for me
Where the wrath I deserve
It is gone, it has passed
Your blood has hidden me

CHORUS:
Mercy, mercy
As endless as the sea
I'll sing Your hallelujah
For all eternity

We will lift up the cup
And the bread we will break
Remembering Your love
We were fallen from grace
But You took all our shame
And nailed it to a cross

BRIDGE:
May I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen


TITLE: The Lion and the Lamb
ARTIST: Bethel Music

He's coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms will bow down
And every chain will break
As broken hearts declare His praise
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

CHORUS:
And our God is the lion
The Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power
And fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before Him
Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
Every knee will bow before Him

So, open up the gates
Make way before the King of Kings
The God who comes to save
Is here to set the captives free
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

BRIDGE:
For who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty


TITLE: No Longer Slaves
ARTIST: Bethel Music

You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

CHORUS:
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins

BRIDGE:
You split the sea so I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me and I will stand and sing
I am a child of God

BRIDGE:
Once dead in sin but now alive in Jesus
Redeemed from slavery by His blood
You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God
