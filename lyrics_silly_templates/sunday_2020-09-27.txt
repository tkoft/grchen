SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Psalm 86:8-13</b>
There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours.
<b>All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God.</b>
Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name.
<b>I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever. For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.</b>
Let us worship together!

TITLE: More Like Jesus
ARTIST: Passion

You came to the world you created
Trading your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost

Counting your status as nothing,
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with your love

CHORUS:
If more of You means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You is all I need
Take everything

You are my life and my treasure
The one that I can't live without
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down

BRIDGE:
Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my hearts in your hands
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus

BRIDGE:
This world
Is dying to know who You are
You've shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus


TITLE: Ancient of Days
ARTIST: CityAlight

Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains
That my God is, the Ancient of Days

CHORUS:
None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days

Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul
He is here with me, I am not alone
O His love is sure, and He knows my name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see what the future brings
I will watch and wait for the Saviour King
Then my joy complete, standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>Merciful God, because of the great love with which You loved us, you made us alive together with Christ, yet we wallow in the death of sin. You raised us up with Christ, yet we follow the course of this wayward world. You seated us with Christ in the heavenly places, yet we succumb to the power and influence of lowly, evil spirits. Forgive us for our pride and unbelief, and enable us to walk in the good works that You prepared beforehand for us. Help us to keep our eyes on Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross and is now seated at Your right hand. Amen.</b>
Ephesians 2:1-10, Hebrews 12:1-2

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>2 Corinthians 5:17-19</b>
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Algeria, Week 4: Missions & Neighbors</b>
There are an estimated 100,000 believers in Algeria, which is encouraging growth from past decades and centuries, but there is so much more outreach needed in a population of 44 million people. There has been little success in reaching Algerians with the gospel, much because of deep wounds from a history of colonialism, crusades, and invasions causing distrust of anything perceived as Western, including Christianity. There are an estimated 889 missionaries needed for the country of Algeria, and there is a need for God to call together prayer teams who will intercede on behalf of Algerians for open hearts, new outreach strategies, and access to this country which is closed to missionaries and very difficult with visa approval. However, Radio broadcast, satellite TV, and social media have been effective at reaching people with the news about Jesus Christ, more use of these things is needed in sharing the gospel.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for God to soften the hearts of Algerians to see Christianity as a truly Algerian religion, not originally a Western religion</li>
    <li>Pray for God to raise up prayer teams for Algeria to help break up the soil through intercession, to call people into service for Algeria, and for creative and effective ways of outreach</li>
</ul>

SECTION: Our Membership Covenant

Having been brought by God’s sovereign grace into the fellowship of the Spirit through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, and having been baptized upon our profession of faith, we do now, in the presence of God, angels, and this assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one another as one body in Christ.
<br>We endeavor, therefore, to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength: to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and peace; to promote the church’s spirituality and fruitfulness; to not neglect assembling together, but to sustain its worship, sacraments, and discipline; to welcome, and test biblically, instruction from the Scriptures by the elders of the church, seeking to grow toward biblical unity in the truth; to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel through all nations.
<br>We also endeavor to love one another: to remember one another in prayer; to aid one another in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and courtesy in speech; to avoid gossip, backbiting and excessive anger; to be slow to take offense, but quick to seek reconciliation and mindful of the rules of our Savior to secure it without delay; to admonish erring members whose sins require it, and to support the leadership of the elders in corporate discipline to secure their repentance and reconciliation.
<br>We further endeavor to share the love of Christ with others: to educate our children in the Christian faith; to seek the salvation of our kindred and neighbors; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment.
<br>We moreover endeavor, if we remove from this place, to unite as soon as possible with a like-minded church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant.May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all. Amen.


TITLE: I Surrender All
ARTIST: Judson W. Van DeVenter

All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

CHORUS:
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender
Humbly at His feet I bow
Worldly pleasures all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, take me now

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.


TITLE: From the Inside Out
ARTIST: Hillsong UNITED

A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
And should I stumble again
I'm caught in Your grace
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

CHORUS:
In my heart and my soul
Lord I give You control
Consume me from the inside out,
Lord, let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

CHORUS:
Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord my soul cries out
