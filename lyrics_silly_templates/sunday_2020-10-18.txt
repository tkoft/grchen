TITLE: God of Revivial
ARTIST: Bethel Music

We've seen what You can do, oh, God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before, in greater measure
You will do again

CHORUS:
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible

CHORUS:
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
God of revival

You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You've defeated?
I will trust in You alone

BRIDGE:
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out


TITLE: From Whom All Blessings Flow (Doxology)
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

What gift of love could I offer to a King
What weight or worth could be held within my offering
When He alone is worthy

A glory song is inscribed upon my heart
This treasure held in an alabaster jar I break
To bring Him all the glory

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below

What sacrifice could be equal to His own
The cross of Christ has declared that there is nought I owe
Yet I know I owe Him all

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise God from whom all blessings flow

Our Father God the infinite
The matchless King magnificent

The living Christ
The servant Son
The prophesied
The saving One

The Holy Ghost gift from above
The faithful Friend
The seal of love

This life, this heart
This song to Him
My all in all
My everything

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost


SECTION: Confession of Sin
<b>Almighty God, we confess how hard it is to be your people. You have called us to be the church, to continue the mission of Jesus Christ to our lonely and confused world. Yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active, isolated than involved, callous than compassionate, obstinate than obedient, legalistic than loving. Gracious Lord, have mercy upon us and forgive our sins. Remove the obstacles preventing us from being your representatives to a broken world. Awaken our hearts to the promised gift of your indwelling Spirit. We pray in Jesus’ powerful name. Amen.</b>

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>Revelation 21:6</b>
"And he said to me, ‘It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of
the water of life without payment."
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Bangladesh, Week 3: The Church</b>
Although Bangladesh claims religious freedom, discrimination has been increasing. Christianity is a very small minority, and both Protestants and Catholics face persecution. This past 2020 reporting period for Open Doors, an organization assessing religious persecution, there were multiple death threats to Christians, and 14 churches were destroyed through burning and other means. An ethnic minority person, such as a Rohingya, who also belongs to a religious minority, is most threatened. Discrimination is propagated both by communities and authorities, so there is little justice or protection for many of these people.

Rohingya are Muslim people who have fled violence and ethnic cleansing from Myanmar into Bangladesh in a mass exodus of 700,000 people in 2017. They are one of the world’s most highly persecuted minorities and are unengaged with the gospel. About 1 million are now living in refugee camps, one which has become the largest in the world. Here there are many challenges they still face, from continued discrimination, to tensions with the Bangladesh government over what to do with them.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for continued growth, endurance, and joy for Bangladeshi and Rohingya believers, despite intensifying injustice and persecution</li>
    <li>Pray for the unreached Rohingya people to know the Father’s love for them through Christ Jesus, who himself was killed by authorities</li>
</ul>

SECTION: Invitation to the Lord's Supper
This Supper proclaims the death of our Lord Jesus until he comes again in glory, when he will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more.
<b>It points to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, where we shall be the bride of Christ--all those who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</b>

SECTION: Commemoration
Therefore we proclaim our faith as signified and sealed in this sacrament: <b>Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again.</b>
