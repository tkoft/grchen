SECTION: Call to Worship
<b>Psalm 103:13-22</b>
“As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
<b>As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.</b>
But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
<b>Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones
who do his word, obeying the voice of his word! Bless
the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will!
Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his
dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!”</b>
Let us bless the LORD together!


TITLE: Speak O Lord
ARTIST: Keith & Kristyn Getty

Speak O Lord as we come to You
To receive the food of Your holy word
Take Your truth plant it deep in us
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith
Speak O Lord and fulfill in us
All Your promises for Your glory

Teach us Lord full obedience
Holy reverence true humility
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity
Cause our faith to rise cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority
Words of power that can never fail
Let their truth prevail over unbelief

Speak O Lord and renew our minds
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity
And by grace we’ll stand on Your promises
And by faith we’ll walk as You walk with us
Speak O Lord till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory


TITLE: God of Revivial
ARTIST: Bethel Music

We've seen what You can do, oh, God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before, in greater measure
You will do again

CHORUS:
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible

CHORUS:
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
God of revival

You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You've defeated?
I will trust in You alone

BRIDGE:
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out



SECTION: Confession of Sin
O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens. When we look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in place, what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. ...
You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, to rule the earth and lead Your worship as your image-bearer. But, alas, the crown has fallen from our heads: We have sinned; We are alien to You; Our heads are deceitful and wicked, our minds an enemy to Your law. ...
Yet, in our lostness You have laid help on Your Son Jesus Christ and He comes between to put His hands on us both, our Umpire, our Mediator, whose blood is our peace, whose righteousness is our strength, whose condemnation is our freedom, whose Spirit is our power, whose heaven is our heritage. ...
Grant that we may feel more the strength of Your grace in subduing the evil of our nature, in loosing us from the present evil world, in supporting us under the trials of life, in enabling us to abide with You in our valleys, in exercising us to have a conscience void of offense before You and before men. In all our affairs may we distinguish between duty and anxiety, and may our character and not our circumstances chiefly engage us.

SECTION: Assurance of Pardon
<b>Acts 13:38; Ephesians 1:7</b>
"Through Jesus Christ forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. In Christ we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.”

<ul>
    <li>That God would help us to speak wise words fitly spoken, speaking truth in love, benefiting those who listen, and giving comfort to the broken</li>
    <li>That we would be faithful messengers of the Lord Jesus and bring refreshing and joy to his heart</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<b>Christ the Redeemer (Quincy, MA)</b>

<b>China, Week 1: Intro</b>
<i>Parable of the sower, Matthew 13:8: “Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty”</i>

This month we are praying for China. China is an amazing nation that God deeply loves as its Creator and the one who personally came to earth as a man and shed his blood for each of the 1.4 billion people currently living there. China has the largest population in the world, the largest cities, a massive global economy, a rich history and heritage, and is demographically and geographically filled with diversity.

The church has experienced incredible blessing and growth despite intense struggles over the past decades so that it has become a huge church movement with possibly one of the highest percentages of Christians in the world. Despite this, there is still a great need for the 146 million Chinese people that remain unreached with the good news of Christ.

<ul>
    <li>Pray for God to continue moving in and unleashing the church with a burden for those still without the good news of Christ in China</li>
    <li>Pray for the church in China to be a seed that produces grain a hundredfold than what was planted, blessing the peoples and nations around them with Christ’s love</li>
</ul>


SECTION: Invitation to the Lord's Supper
Christ calls the bread his body and the cup his blood, or the new covenant in his blood. He wants to teach us that just as bread and wine nourish the temporal life, so too his crucified body and poured-out blood are the true food and drink of our souls for eternal life.
<b>But more important, he wants to assure us, by this visible sign and pledge, that we, through the Holy Spirit’s work, share in his true body and blood as surely as our mouths receive these holy signs in his remembrance, and that all of his suffering and obedience are as definitely ours as if we personally had suffered and made satisfaction for our sins.</b>

<i>(Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 79)
John 6:51, 55; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 11:26; Rom. 6:5-11</i>

SECTION: Commemoration
According to his commandment:
<b>We remember his death.
We proclaim his resurrection.
We await his coming in glory.</b>


TITLE: Reformation Song
ARTIST: Sovereign Grace Music

Your Word alone is solid ground
The mighty rock on which we build
In every line the truth is found
And every page with glory filled

CHORUS:
Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone
Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone

Through faith alone we come to You
We have no merit we can claim
Sure that Your promises are true
We place our hope in Jesus’ name

In Christ alone we’re justified
His righteousness is all our plea
Your law’s demands are satisfied
His perfect work has set us free

By grace alone we have been saved
All that we are has come from You
Hearts that were once by sin enslaved
Now by Your power have been made new


TITLE: King of Kings
ARTIST: Hillsong Worship

In the darkness, we were waiting
Without hope, without light
'Til from Heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

CHORUS:
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died

And the morning that You rose
All of Heaven held its breath
'Til that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored

And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me, ohh
