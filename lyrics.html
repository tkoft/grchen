                <h2>Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery</h2>
                <h3>Matt Papa, Matt Boswell, Michael Bleecker</h3>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
In the dawning of the King
He the theme of heaven’s praises
Robed in frail humanity
</p>
                    <p class="">In our longing, in our darkness
Now the light of life has come
Look to Christ, who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
He the perfect Son of Man
In His living, in His suffering
Never trace nor stain of sin
</p>
                    <p class="">See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law; in Him we stand
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory
</p>
                    <p class="">See the price of our redemption
See the Father’s plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured, love untold
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e’er restrain Him
Praise the Lord; He is alive!
</p>
                    <p class="">What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when he comes
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="songContainer">
                <h2>How Firm a Foundation</h2>
                <h3>1787</h3>
                    <p class="">How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He hath said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled
</p>
                    <p class="">Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand
</p>
                    <p class="">In ev’ry condition—in sickness, in health,
In poverty’s vale or abounding in wealth,
At home or abroad, on the land or the sea—
As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be
</p>
                    <p class="">When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine
</p>
                    <p class="">The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="songContainer">
                <h2>Lord I Need You</h2>
                <h3>Matt Maher</h3>
                    <p class="">Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You&#x27;re the One that guides my heart
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
</p>
                    <p class="">Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
Where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand I&#x27;ll fall on You
Jesus, You&#x27;re my hope and stay
</p>

                <h2>Reformation Song</h2>
                <h3>Sovereign Grace Music</h3>
                    <p class="">Your Word alone is solid ground,
The mighty rock on which we build;
In every line the truth is found
And every page with glory filled.
</p>
                    <p class="">Through faith alone we come to You;
We have no merit we can claim.
Sure that Your promises are true,
We place our hope in Jesus’ name.
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone;
Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone.
</p>
                    <p class="">In Christ alone we’re justified;
His righteousness is all our plea;
Your law’s demands are satisfied;
His perfect work has set us free.
</p>
                    <p class="">By grace alone we have been saved;
All that we are has come from You.
Hearts that were once by sin enslaved
Now by Your pow’r have been made new.
</p>
                    <p class="">And on this Reformation day
We join with saints of old to sing
We lift our hearts as one in praise
Glory to Christ our gracious King
