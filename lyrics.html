                <h3>Bethel Music</h3>
                    <p class="">Old things have passed away
Your love has stayed the same
Your constant grace remains the cornerstone
</p>
                    <p class="">Things that we thought were dead
Are breathing in life again
You cause your Son to shine on darkest nights
</p>
                    <p class="">For all that you&#x27;ve done, we will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Jesus we love you
Oh how we love you
You are the one our, our hearts adore
</p>
                    <p class="">The hopeless have found their hope
The orphans now have a home
All that was lost has found its place in you
</p>
                    <p class="">You lift our weary head
You make us strong instead
You took these rags and made us beautiful
</p>
                    <p class="">For all that you&#x27;ve done, we will pour out our love
This will be our anthem song
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus
Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus

                <h2>More Like Jesus</h2>
                <h3>Passion</h3>
                    <p class="">You came to the world you created
Trading your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost
</p>
                    <p class="">Counting your status as nothing,
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with your love
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">If more of You means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You is all I need
Take everything
</p>
                    <p class="">You are my life and my treasure
The one that I can&#x27;t live without
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my hearts in your hands
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">This world
Is dying to know who You are
You&#x27;ve shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus

                <h3>CityAlight</h3>
                    <p class="">What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
