    <h3>"Trust and Obey"</h3>
    <p>When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

    <i>Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
    To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.</i>

Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,
But is blessed if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows, for the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.
    </p>

    <h3>"Presence, Power, Glory" by Citipointe Live</h3>
    <p>Strip me back of all my pride, my possessions
'Til all I want and all I seek is Your presence

Awake in me
A fire and a zeal
A fire full of love
Heaven open up

    <i>So come and fill this place
    With Your mercy, with Your grace
    Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
    With power and with love
    All consuming fire come
    Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit</i>

We want more of Your presence
We want more of Your power
We want more of Your glory
We want to know You

    <h3>"Look How He Lifted Me" by Elevation Worship</h3>
    <p>My world was shaken, my heart was broken
My hope was fading, the walls were closing in
But now I'm singing, look how He lifted me

My life was sinking, my days were numbered
The waves were crashing, the flood was coming in
Oh Hallelujah, look how He lifted me

    <i>Look how He lifted me
    His grace and mercy is my testimony
    For every victory
    I've got a song to sing
    Look how He lifted me!</i>

He turned my mourning back into dancing
He turned my weeping into a shout again
And now I'm singing, look how He lifted me

He rolled my sorrows away at calvary
He rose in triumph over the enemy
Oh Hallelujah, look how he lifted me

    <i>When nothing else could help
    Your love came down, Your love came down
    When nothing else could help
    Your love came down and lifted me</i>
    </p>
