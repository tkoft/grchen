    <h3>"Only Wanna Sing" by Hillsong Y&F</h3>
    <p>This is no performance
Lord I pray it’s worship
Empty words I can’t afford

I’m not chasing feelings
That’s not why I’m singing
You’re the reason for my song

    <i>I only wanna sing
    If I sing with everything
    If I sing for you my King

    I can’t imagine why
    I would do this all for hype
    Cause it’s all to lift You high</i>

You don’t want perfection
Just my soul’s attention
All I have is what I’ll give

More than a song that'll last a moment
I live a life of honest worship
If I'm here to sing then I'll sing with purpose
All the praise, Lord, You deserve it
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>"You Are My Vision" by Rend Collective</h3>
    <p>You are my vision, O King of my heart
Nothing else satisfies, only You Lord
You are my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Your presence my light

You are my wisdom, You are my true word
I ever with You, and You with me Lord
You're my great Father, and I'm Your true son
You dwell inside me, together we're one 

You are my battle-shield, sword for the fight
You are my dignity, You're my delight
You're my soul's shelter and You're my high tower
Come raise me heavenward, O power of my power

I don't want riches or man's empty praise
You're my inheritance, now and always
You and You only, the first in my heart
High king of Heaven, my treasure You are

High King of Heaven, when victory's won
May I reach Heaven's joy, O bright Heaven's Son
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O ruler of all
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>"Happy Day" by Tim Hughes</h3>
    <p>The greatest day in history
Death is beaten, You have rescued me
Sing it out, Jesus is alive

The empty cross, the empty grave
Life eternal, You have won the day
Shout it out, Jesus is alive
He's alive

        <i>Oh, happy day, happy day
        You washed my sin away
        Oh, happy day, happy day
        I'll never be the same
        Forever I am changed</i>

When I stand in that place
Free at last, meeting face to face
I am yours, Jesus, You are mine

Endless joy, perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate, Jesus is alive
He's alive

    <i>Oh, what a glorious day
    What a glorious way
    That You have saved me
    And oh, what a glorious day
    What a glorious name</i>
</p>

    <h3>"Before the Throne of God Above"</h3>
    <p>Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea:
A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

    My name is graven on His hands,
    My name is written on His heart;
    I know that while in heaven He stands
    No tongue can bid me thence depart
    No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin.

    Because the sinless Savior died,
    My sinful soul is counted free;
    For God the just is satisfied
    To look on Him and pardon me
    To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the Risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I am,
The King of glory and of grace!

    One with Himself I cannot die
    My soul is purchased by His blood
    My life is hid with Christ on high,
    With Christ, my Savior and my God
    With Christ, my Savior and my God            
    </p>
