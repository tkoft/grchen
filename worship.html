Yet we confess that we too often have chosen to remain captive to doubt and fear and ways that lead to death. By our thoughts, words, and actions, we have scorned your love, diminished the lives of others, and defaced your image in us. Father, forgive us for Jesus’ sake, and enable us by His resurrection power to live no longer for ourselves but for Him who died and rose again for us. Amen.</b>

God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Algeria, Week 2: People & Religion</b>
Algeria has a population of almost 44 million. Northern Africa is predominantly inhabited overall by Arab-Muslims today, but it used to be primarily populated by the Berber people, who make up the original inhabitants of Algeria, and of whom most Algerians can trace descent. Berbers were Christian until around the 6th century when Arab Muslims invaded and immigrated across Northern Africa eventually forcing conversion to Islam. All Berber ethnic groups identify Islam as their religion, but often relate more with their cultural heritage and traditions than with the teachings of the Koran. Islam makes up 96.8% of religion in the total population.
There are 6 million Kabyle Berbers, an ethnic group of Berber people, living mainly in the coastal mountain region of Algeria. Although they are still 99% Muslim, the Spirit has been working among them, and thousands have been coming to Christ in recent years.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for Algerian people who take pride in their heritage to learn and explore the history of where they have come from and to become curious about Jesus Christ</li>
    <li>Pray for Kabyle Berbers to continue coming to Christ and sharing Christ with their own people, despite opposition from authorities and others</li>
</ul>

By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free oh is free indeed

Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised
He’s risen from the grave
