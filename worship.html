                <h2>Call to Worship</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Psalm 146:1-4, 7-10</b>
Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
<b>Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation. When his breath departs he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish.</b>
The LORD sets the prisoners free; the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous. The LORD watches over the sojourners; he upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.
<b>The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!</b>
Let us worship together!

                <h3>CityAlight</h3>
                    <p class="">Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains
That my God is, the Ancient of Days
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days
</p>
                    <p class="">Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul
He is here with me, I am not alone
O His love is sure, and He knows my name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days
</p>
                    <p class="">Though I may not see what the future brings
I will watch and wait for the Saviour King
Then my joy complete, standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

                <h2>How Deep the Father&#x27;s Love For Us</h2>
                <h3>Stuart Townend</h3>
                    <p class="">How deep the Father’s love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure
How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory
</p>
                    <p class="">Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished
</p>
                    <p class="">I will not boast in anything
No gifts no power no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection
Why should I gain from His reward
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

                <h2>Confession of Sin</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Almighty God, in raising Jesus from the tomb you have given us the sure sign of your power to deliver us from sin and death and to renew our whole creation. We confess that we still fall into doubt and fear. We continue to cling to selfish ways and doubt your power to make all things new. Forgive our lack of faith. Have mercy on our weakness. Raise us from the death of sin that we may live with Christ in the joy of his resurrection, now and forever.</b>

                <h2>Assurance of Pardon</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Romans 8:31-34, 38-39</b>
"If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us... For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

<b>Bangladesh, Week 1: News & Events</b>
Like every nation, Bangladesh has been hit hard with the Covid pandemic and has struggled to manage, especially with a healthcare system that was already insufficient to care for much of the country’s existing needs. Closure of factories and other attempts at slowing transmission has resulted in high rates of unemployment causing other concerns such as hunger - food more desperately needed than soap, masks, or other health safety. In addition to the pandemic, Bangladesh has been overwhelmed with flooding; the past two years have seen the most intense rainfall in decades. Bangladesh yearly experiences heavy monsoon flooding that destroys much of its infrastructure, but this year has been more challenging as people struggle to find shelter and are much more vulnerable to all sorts of diseases along with Covid. Some people see little difference between dying of starvation and dying from the virus, the best thing available to many are their prayers. Bangladeshi’s have lost much this year.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for the flourishing of Bangladesh, for relief from flooding, infection, and economic toll, and for the building of good, long-lasting infrastructure</li>
    <li>Pray for Bangladeshi’s to discover through their prayers what can never be taken from them by disease, disaster, or death, the hope of Jesus Christ</li>
