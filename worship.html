        <h2>Come As You Are</h2>
        <h3>Crowder</h3>
            <p class="">Come out of sadness
From wherever you&#x27;ve been
Come broken hearted
Let rescue begin
Come find your mercy
Oh sinner come kneel
Earth has no sorrow
That heaven can&#x27;t heal
Earth has no sorrow
That heaven can&#x27;t heal
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">So lay down your burdens
Lay down your shame
All who are broken
Lift up your face
Oh wanderer come home
You&#x27;re not too far
So lay down your hurt
Lay down your heart
Come as you are
</p>
            <p class="">There&#x27;s hope for the hopeless
And all those who&#x27;ve strayed
Come sit at the table
Come taste the grace
There&#x27;s rest for the weary
Rest that endures
Earth has no sorrow
That heaven can&#x27;t cure
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">So lay down your burdens
Lay down your shame
All who are broken
Lift up your face
Oh wanderer come home
You&#x27;re not too far
Lay down your hurt lay down your heart
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Come as you are
Come as you are
Fall in his arms
Come as you are
</p>
            <p class="">There&#x27;s joy for the morning
Oh sinner be still
Earth has no sorrow
That heaven can&#x27;t heal
Earth has no sorrow
That heaven can&#x27;t heal

        <h2>You Alone Can Rescue</h2>
        <h3>Matt Redman</h3>
            <p class="">Who, oh Lord, could save themselves
Their own soul could heal?
Our shame was deeper than the sea
Your grace is deeper still
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">You alone can rescue
You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us
Led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise
</p>
            <p class="">You, oh Lord, have made a way
The great divide You heal
For when our hearts were far away
Your love went further still
Yes, Your love goes further still
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You&#x27;re the Giver of Life
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You&#x27;re the Giver of Life

        <h2>Psalm 34</h2>
        <h3>Shane and Shane</h3>
            <p class="">I sought the Lord
And He answered me
And delivered me
From every fear
Those who look on Him
Are radiant
They&#x27;ll never be ashamed
They&#x27;ll never be ashamed
</p>
            <p class="">This poor man cried
And the Lord heard me
And saved me from
My enemies
The Son of God
Surrounds His saints
He will deliver them
He will deliver them
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Magnify the Lord in me
Come exalt His name together
Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever
</p>
            <p class="">Taste and see
That the Lord is good
Oh bless us here
Who hides in Him
Oh fear the Lord
Oh all you saints
He&#x27;ll give you everything
He&#x27;ll give you everything
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Neverending praise
May our incense rise

        <h2>Yet Not I but Through Christ in Me</h2>
        <h3>CityAlight</h3>
            <p class="">What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
            <p class="">The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
            <p class="">No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
            <p class="">With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
