        <h2>10,000 Reasons</h2>
        <h3>Matt Redman</h3>
            <p class="">The sun comes up
It’s a new day dawning
It’s time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I’ll worship Your Holy name
</p>
            <p class="">You’re rich in love
And You’re slow to anger
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find
</p>
            <p class="">And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore

        <h2>When I Think About the Lord</h2>
        <h3>Shane &amp; Shane</h3>
            <p class="">When I think about the Lord
How He saved me how He raised me
How He filled me with the Holy Ghost
How He healed me to the uttermost
</p>
            <p class="">When I think about the Lord
How He picked me up and turned me around
How He placed my feet on solid ground
It makes me wanna shout
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Hallelujah thank You Jesus
Lord You&#x27;re worthy of all the glory
And all the honor and all the praise

        <h2>Good and Gracious King</h2>
        <h3>CityAlight</h3>
            <p class="">I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King
</p>
            <p class="">I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">You deserve the greater glory
Overcome I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You&#x27;re a good and gracious King
</p>
            <p class="">O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Holy holy Lord Almighty
Good and gracious
Good and gracious
Holy holy Lord Almighty
Good and gracious King

        <h2>King of Kings</h2>
        <h3>Hillsong Worship</h3>
            <p class="">In the darkness, we were waiting
Without hope, without light
&#x27;Til from Heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
</p>
            <p class="">To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died
</p>
            <p class="">And the morning that You rose
All of Heaven held its breath
&#x27;Til that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who&#x27;d come
To the Father are restored
</p>
            <p class="">And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me, ohh
