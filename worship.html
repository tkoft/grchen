You have called us to be the church, to continue the mission of Jesus Christ to our lonely and confused world. Yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active, isolated than involved, callous than compassionate, obstinate than obedient, legalistic than loving. Gracious Lord, have mercy upon us and forgive our sins. Remove the obstacles preventing us from being your representatives to a broken world. Awaken our hearts to the promised gift of your indwelling Spirit. We pray in Jesus’ powerful name. Amen.</b>

<b>Bangladesh, Week 3: The Church</b>
Although Bangladesh claims religious freedom, discrimination has been increasing. Christianity is a very small minority, and both Protestants and Catholics face persecution. This past 2020 reporting period for Open Doors, an organization assessing religious persecution, there were multiple death threats to Christians, and 14 churches were destroyed through burning and other means. An ethnic minority person, such as a Rohingya, who also belongs to a religious minority, is most threatened. Discrimination is propagated both by communities and authorities, so there is little justice or protection for many of these people.
Rohingya are Muslim people who have fled violence and ethnic cleansing from Myanmar into Bangladesh in a mass exodus of 700,000 people in 2017. They are one of the world’s most highly persecuted minorities and are unengaged with the gospel. About 1 million are now living in refugee camps, one which has become the largest in the world. Here there are many challenges they still face, from continued discrimination, to tensions with the Bangladesh government over what to do with them.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for continued growth, endurance, and joy for Bangladeshi and Rohingya believers, despite intensifying injustice and persecution</li>
    <li>Pray for the unreached Rohingya people to know the Father’s love for them through Christ Jesus, who himself was killed by authorities</li>
</ul>
