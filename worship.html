        <h2>Lord I Need You</h2>
        <h3>Matt Maher</h3>
            <p class="">Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You&#x27;re the One that guides my heart
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You
</p>
            <p class="">Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
Where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand I&#x27;ll fall on You
Jesus, You&#x27;re my hope and stay
</p>

        <h2>Crowns</h2>
        <h3>Hillsong Worship</h3>
            <p class="">There is a hill I cherish
Where stood a precious tree
The emblem of salvation
The gift of Calvary
</p>
            <p class="">How is it I should profit
While He is crucified
Yet as His life was taken
So I was granted mine
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">My wealth is in the cross
Thereâ€™s nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
</p>
            <p class="">I will not boast in riches
I have no pride in gold
But I will boast in Jesus
And in His Name alone
</p>
            <p class="">And when I stand in glory
My crowns before the Lord
Let this be my confession
My wealth is in the cross
</p>

        <h2>Christ Is Enough</h2>
        <h3>Hillsong Worship</h3>
            <p class="">Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion
Now there&#x27;s nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy
Through every trial
My soul will sing
No turning back
I&#x27;ve been set free
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need
</p>
            <p class="">Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home
Through every storm
My soul will sing
Jesus is here
To God be the glory
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back
No turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back
No turning back
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
No turning back
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
No turning back

        <h2>Christ Is Risen</h2>
        <h3>Matt Maher</h3>
            <p class="">Let no one caught in sin remain
Inside the lie of inward shame
We fix our eyes upon the cross
And run to Him who showed great love
And bled for us
Freely You&#x27;ve bled for us
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
</p>
            <p class="">Beneath the weight of all our sin
You bowed to none but Heaven&#x27;s will
No scheme of Hell, no scoffer&#x27;s crown
No burden great can hold You down
In strength You reign
Forever let Your church proclaim
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
The glory of God has defeated the night
</p>
