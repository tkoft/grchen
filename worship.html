                <h2>Sooner Count the Stars</h2>
                <h3>Sovereign Grace Music</h3>
                    <p class="">I could sooner count the stars
Than number all Your ways
Though I only know in part
That part exceeds all praise
As sunlight fills the skies
Your goodness fills my life
For all Your precious gifts
Receive my gratefulness
</p>
                    <p class="">I could sooner drink the seas
Than fathom all Your love
Like a never ceasing stream
Are mercies through Your Son
The death of Christ alone
Deserves eternal song
For such a love as His
Receive my gratefulness
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">No praise is high enough
No thanks is deep enough
No life is long enough
To tell of all Youâ€™ve done
No shout is loud enough
No words are strong enough
No song is sweet enough
To sing Your love
</p>
                    <p class="">I could sooner turn back time
Than turn Your heart away
Though the years go fleeting by
Your mercies never change
Before You made the sun
Your love was set on us
For all Your faithfulness
Receive my gratefulness

                <h3>Chris Tomlin</h3>
                    <p class="">Do you feel the world is broken?
(We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen?
(We do)
But do you know that all the dark won&#x27;t
Stop the light from getting through?
(We do)
Do you wish that you could see it all made new?
We do)
</p>
                    <p class="">Is all creation groaning?
(It is)
Is a new creation coming?
(It is)
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst?
(It is)
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this?
(It is)
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He was David&#x27;s root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is
</p>
                    <p class="">Does the Father truly love us?
(He does)
Does the Spirit move among us?
(He does)
And does Jesus, our Messiah hold forever those He loves?
(He does)
Does our God intend to dwell again with us?
(He does)
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Is anyone worthy?
Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David&#x27;s root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">He is, He is, He is, He is
He is worthy! He is worthy!
Of all blessing and honor and glory
He is worthy of this
He is

                <h2>Yet Not I But Through Christ In Me</h2>
                <h3>CityAlight</h3>
                    <p class="">What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing, &quot;All is mine&quot;
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing, &quot;I am free&quot;
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

                <h2>Here I Am to Worship</h2>
                <h3>Michael W. Smith</h3>
                    <p class="">Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You&#x27;re my God
You&#x27;re altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
</p>
                    <p class="">King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love&#x27;s sake became poor

                <h2>Jesus I My Cross Have Taken</h2>
                <h3>Indelible Grace</h3>
                    <p class="">Jesus, I my cross have taken
All to leave and follow Thee
Destitute, despised, forsaken
Thou from hence my all shall be
Perish every fond ambition
All Ive sought or hoped or known
Yet how rich is my condition!
God and heaven are still my own
</p>
                    <p class="">Let the world despise and leave me
They have left my Savior, too
Human hearts and looks deceive me
Thou art not, like them, untrue
O while Thou dost smile upon me
God of wisdom, love, and might
Foes may hate and friends disown me
Show Thy face and all is bright
</p>
                    <p class="">Man may trouble and distress me
Twill but drive me to Thy breast
Life with trials hard may press me
Heaven will bring me sweeter rest
Oh, tis not in grief to harm me
While Thy love is left to me
Oh, twere not in joy to charm me
Were that joy unmixed with Thee
</p>
                    <p class="">Go, then, earthly fame and treasure
Come disaster, scorn and pain
In Thy service, pain is pleasure
With Thy favor, loss is gain
I have called Thee Abba Father
I have stayed my heart on Thee
Storms may howl, and clouds may gather
All must work for good to me
</p>
                    <p class="">Soul, then know thy full salvation
Rise oer sin and fear and care
Joy to find in every station
Something still to do or bear
Think what Spirit dwells within thee
Think what Fathers smiles are thine
Think that Jesus died to win thee
Child of heaven, canst thou repine
</p>
                    <p class="">Haste thee on from grace to glory
Armed by faith, and winged by prayer
Heavens eternal days before thee
Gods own hand shall guide us there
Soon shall close thy earthly mission
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days
Hope shall change to glad fruition
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise
