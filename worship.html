        <h2>Here I Am to Worship</h2>
        <h3>Michael W. Smith</h3>
            <p class="">Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You&#x27;re my God
You&#x27;re altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
</p>
            <p class="">King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love&#x27;s sake became poor
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">I&#x27;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I&#x27;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
</p>

        <h2>Whom Shall I Fear</h2>
        <h3>Chris Tomlin</h3>
            <p class="">You hear me when I call
You are my morning song
Though darkness fills the night
It cannot hide the light
Whom shall I fear?
</p>
            <p class="">You crush the enemy
Underneath my feet
You are my sword and shield
Though troubles linger still
Whom shall I fear?
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">I know who goes before me, I know who stands behind
The God of angel armies is always by my side
The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine
The God of angel armies is always by my side
</p>
            <p class="">My strength is in your name
For you alone can save
You will deliver me
Yours is the victory
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Nothing formed against me shall stand
You hold the whole world in your hands
I&#x27;m holding on to your promises
You are faithful, You are faithful
</p>

        <div class="songContainer">
        <h2>You Alone Can Rescue</h2>
        <h3>Matt Redman</h3>
            <p class="">Who, oh Lord, could save themselves
Their own soul could heal?
Our shame was deeper than the sea
Your grace is deeper still
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">You alone can rescue, You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us, led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise
</p>
            <p class="">You, oh Lord, have made a way
The great divide You heal
For when our hearts were far away
Your love went further still
Yes, your love goes further still
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You’re the Giver of Life
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You’re the Giver of Life

        <h2>At the Cross (Love Ran Red)</h2>
        <h3>Chris Tomlin</h3>
            <p class="">There&#x27;s a place where mercy reigns
And never dies
There&#x27;s a place where streams of grace
Flow deep and wide
</p>
            <p class="">Where all the love I&#x27;ve ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">At the cross, at the cross
I surrender my life
I&#x27;m in awe of You, I&#x27;m in awe of You
Where Your love ran red
And my sin washed white
I owe all to You, I owe all to You
Jesus
</p>
            <p class="">There&#x27;s a place where sin and shame
Are powerless
Where my heart has peace with God
And forgiveness
</p>
            <p class="">Where all the love I&#x27;ve ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Here my hope is found
Here on holy ground
Here I bow down, here I bow down
Here arms open wide
Here You save my life
Here I bow down, here I bow

        <h2>This I Believe (The Creed)</h2>
        <h3>Hillsong Worship</h3>
            <p class="">Our Father everlasting
The all creating One
God Almighty
Through Your Holy Spirit
Conceiving Christ the Son
Jesus our Savior
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">I believe in God our Father

Our God is three in one
I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the name of Jesus

Suffered and crucified
Forgiveness is in You
Descended into darkness
You rose in glorious life
Forever seated high
</p>

I believe You rose again
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">I believe in life eternal
I believe in the virgin birth
I believe in the saints&#x27; communion
And in Your holy Church
I believe in the resurrection
When Jesus comes again
For I believe, in the name of Jesus
