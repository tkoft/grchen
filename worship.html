                <h2>Call to Worship</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Luke 2:8-14</b>
“And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.
<b>And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”</b>
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
<b>“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”</b>
Let us worship our God together!

                <h2>Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery</h2>
                <h3>Matt Papa, Matt Boswell, Michael Bleecker</h3>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
In the dawning of the King
He the theme of heaven’s praises
Robed in frail humanity
</p>
                    <p class="">In our longing, in our darkness
Now the light of life has come
Look to Christ, who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
He the perfect Son of Man
In His living, in His suffering
Never trace nor stain of sin
</p>
                    <p class="">See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law; in Him we stand
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory
</p>
                    <p class="">See the price of our redemption
See the Father’s plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured, love untold
</p>
                    <p class="">Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e’er restrain Him
Praise the Lord; He is alive!
</p>
                    <p class="">What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when he comes
</p>

                <h2>How Firm a Foundation</h2>
                <h3>1787</h3>
                    <p class="">How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He hath said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled
</p>
                    <p class="">Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand
</p>
                    <p class="">In ev’ry condition—in sickness, in health,
In poverty’s vale or abounding in wealth,
At home or abroad, on the land or the sea—
As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be
</p>
                    <p class="">When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine
</p>
                    <p class="">The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake

                <h2>Confession of Sin</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Lord, in your mercy hear our prayer. We confess that it is still all too easy for us to sacrifice our convictions for convenience, your standards for status, your principles for promotion, your absolutes for our ambition, our souls for shallow and unsatisfying success. How easily we are seduced by power, prestige, pleasure, or possessions— seduced into violating our integrity or harming our fellowship with you. From earth’s fullest bliss we turn to you again, unfulfilled. Forgive us our half-hearted devotion and our double-minded spirit. In the name of Christ who gave himself to save us we pray. Amen.</b>

                <div class="sectionText"><b>Ephesians 5:25-27</b>
"Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.”
<b>Thanks be to God.</b>

                <h2>Prayers of the People</h2>
                <div class="sectionText"><b>Trinity Cambridge Church</b>
<ul>
    <li>That God would help us to deeply grasp his grace and justice in Christ, who was made “to be sin who knew no sin” and in whom God “justifies the ungodly”</li>
    <li>That we would grow in holiness and godliness, including in showing no partiality and being people of integrity</li>
</ul>
<b>East Cambridge & Greater Boston</b>
<ul>
    <li>That God’s kingdom would come in our communities so that we demonstrate righteousness and justice instead of partiality and inequality</li>
    <li>That God would have mercy on our city and provide our needs related to COVID’s impact and difficulties, including financial, personal, and health</li>
    <li>For wisdom, prudence, and humility for President Donald Trump, so that he might lead our country well with his decisions and with his example, as well as God’s leading and provision in the upcoming election</li>
</ul>
<b>Crossway Church (Franklin, MA)</b>
<ul>
    <li>Pastors Bauer Evans, Dan Roca, and Dave Magoon</li>
    <li>For the Lord's comfort for those that are suffering during this season</li>
    <li>That they would be a fruitful church, proclaiming the gospel and giving Glory to God</li>
</ul>
<b>Bangladesh, Week 4: Missions</b>
98.8% of the Bangladeshi population of 162 million people remain unreached with the gospel, meaning that in 98.8% of the population there is no indigenous community of believing Christians able to evangelize to their own people groups. 2,683 missionaries are needed to effectively communicate the gospel to Bangladeshi people so that they can in turn effectively reach their own communities and people. This is difficult, more missionaries have been increasingly forced out, and the environment is growing in hostility, but still there has been growth of believers.
The Kayastha people in Bangladesh are 100% Hindu, there is no known church movement within these people who make up the 4th largest population in Bangladesh. Many public, elite figures in politics, education, and other areas of society come from this people group.
<ul>
    <li>Pray for God to send out laborers into the harvest, for our church to be burdened in prayer for Bangladesh, and for us to be sent out to those unreached with the saving news of Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li>Pray for Kayastha Bangladeshi people to have open hearts to hear and receive the gospel, and pray for messengers of the gospel so that they would be able to hear.</li>

Bowing here I find my rest
Without You I fall apart
You&#x27;re the One that guides my heart

Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Where grace is found is where You are
Where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

When temptation comes my way

                <h3>Sovereign Grace Music</h3>
                    <p class="">Your Word alone is solid ground,
The mighty rock on which we build;
In every line the truth is found
And every page with glory filled.
</p>
                    <p class="">Through faith alone we come to You;
We have no merit we can claim.
Sure that Your promises are true,
We place our hope in Jesus’ name.
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone;
Gloria, gloria, glory to God alone.
</p>
                    <p class="">In Christ alone we’re justified;
His righteousness is all our plea;
Your law’s demands are satisfied;
His perfect work has set us free.
</p>
                    <p class="">By grace alone we have been saved;
All that we are has come from You.
Hearts that were once by sin enslaved
Now by Your pow’r have been made new.
</p>
                    <p class="">And on this Reformation day
We join with saints of old to sing
We lift our hearts as one in praise
Glory to Christ our gracious King
