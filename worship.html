                <h2>O Come to the Altar</h2>
                <h3>Elevation Worship</h3>
                    <p class="">Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
</p>
                    <p class="">Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">O come to the altar
The Father&#x27;s arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
</p>
                    <p class="">Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today there&#x27;s no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling 
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">Oh, what a Savior
Isn&#x27;t He wonderful?
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
</p>
                    <p class="">Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found
</p>

                <h2>This Is Amazing Grace</h2>
                <h3>Phil Wickham</h3>
                    <p class="">Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
The King of glory, the King above all kings
</p>
                    <p class="">Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder?
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
The King of glory, the King above all kings
</p>
                    <p class="Chorus">This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You&#x27;ve done for me
</p>
                    <p class="">Who brings our chaos back into order?
Who makes the orphans a son and daughter?
The King of glory, the King of glory
Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of glory, the King above all kings
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy, worthy, worthy

                <h3>CityAlight</h3>
                    <p class="">What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to His
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing, &quot;All is mine&quot;
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need, His power is displayed
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing, &quot;I am free&quot;
Yet not I, but through Christ in me
</p>
                    <p class="">With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
</p>
                    <p class="">To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me

                    <p class="">Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you
Oh, we live for you
</p>
                    <p class="">Jesus, the Name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save (worthy...)
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for you

There is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder
Show me who You are and fill me
With Your heart and lead me
In your love to those around me
</p>
                    <p class="Bridge">I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation
I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken
