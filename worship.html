        <h2>O Come to the Altar</h2>
        <h3>Elevation Worship</h3>
            <p class="">Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself?
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">O come to the altar
The Father&#x27;s arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
</p>
            <p class="">Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today, there&#x27;s no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes, a new life is born
Jesus is calling
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Oh what a Savior
Isn&#x27;t He wonderful?
Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen
</p>
            <p class="">Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you&#x27;ve found
</p>
        </div>
        <div class="songContainer">
        <h2>Abide With Me</h2>
        <h3>Henry Francis Lyte, William Henry Monk</h3>
            <p class="">Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
</p>
            <p class="">Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
Oh You who changes not, abide with me.
</p>
            <p class="">I need Your presence every passing hour:
What but Your grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like Yourself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.
</p>
            <p class="">I fear no foe, with You at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, your victory?
I triumph still, if You abide with me.

        <h2>No Longer Slaves</h2>
        <h3>Bethel Music</h3>
            <p class="">You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">I&#x27;m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I&#x27;m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
</p>
            <p class="">From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I&#x27;ve been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">You split the sea so I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me and I will stand and sing
I am a child of God
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Once dead in sin but now alive in Jesus
Redeemed from slavery by His blood
You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God
</p>

        <h2>More Like Jesus</h2>
        <h3>Kristian Stanfill</h3>
            <p class="">You came to the world you created
Trading your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost
</p>
            <p class="">Counting your status as nothing,
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with your love
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">If more of You means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You is all I need
Take everything
</p>
            <p class="">You are my life and my treasure
The one that I can&#x27;t live without
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my hearts in your hands
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus
This world
Is dying to know who You are
You&#x27;ve shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray make me more like Jesus

        <h2>The Lion and the Lamb</h2>
        <h3>Bethel Music</h3>
            <p class="">He&#x27;s coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms will bow down
And every chain will break
As broken hearts declare His praise
For who can stop the Lord Almighty
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Our God is the lion
The Lion of Judah
He&#x27;s roaring with power
And fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before Him
</p>
            <p class="Chorus">Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
Every knee will bow before Him
</p>
            <p class="">So open up the gates
Make way before the King of Kings
The God who comes to save
Is here to set the captives free
For who can stop the Lord Almighty
</p>
            <p class="Bridge">For who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
