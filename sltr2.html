    <h3>"Look How He Lifted Me" by Elevation Worship</h3>
    <p>My world was shaken
My heart was broken
My hope was fading
The walls were closing in
But now I'm singing
Look how He lifted me

My life was sinking
My days were numbered
The waves were crashing
The flood was coming in
Oh Hallelujah
Look how He lifted me

    <i>Look how He lifted me
    His grace and mercy
    Is my testimony
    For every victory
    I've got a song to sing
    Look how He lifted me!</i>

He turned my mourning
Back into dancing
He turned my weeping
Into a shout again
And now I'm singing
Look how He lifted me

He rolled my sorrows 
Away at calvary
He rose in triumph 
Over the enemy
Oh Hallelujah
Look how he lifted me

    <i>When nothing else could help
    Your love came down
    Your love came down
    When nothing else could help
    Your love came down
    And lifted me</i>
    </p>

    <h3>"Do It Again" by Elevation Worship</h3>
    <p>Walking around these walls
I thought by now they'd fall
But You have never failed me yet

Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For You have never failed me yet

    <i>Your promise still stands
    Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
    I'm still in Your hands
    This is my confidence
    You've never failed me yet</i>

I know the night won't last
Your Word will come to pass
My heart will sing Your praise again

Jesus, You're still enough
Keep me within Your love
My heart will sing Your praise again

    <i>I've seen You move
    You move the mountains
    And I believe
    I'll see You do it again
    You made a way
    Where there was no way
    And I believe
    I'll see You do it again</i>
</p>

    <h3>"Unashamed" by Starfield</h3>
    <p>I have not much to offer You
Not near what You deserve
But still I come because Your cross
Has placed in me my worth

Oh, Christ my King of sympathy
Whose wounds secure my peace
Your grace extends to call me friend
Your mercy sets me free

    <i>And I know I'm weak
    I know I'm unworthy
    To call upon Your name
    But because of grace
    Because of Your mercy
    I stand here unashamed</i>

I can't explain this kind of love
I'm humbled and amazed
That You'd come down
From heavens heights
And greet me face to face

    <i>Here I am at Your feet
    In my brokenness complete
    Here I am at Your feet
    In my brokenness complete</i>
    </p>

    <h3>"Give Me Faith" by Elevation Worship</h3>
    <p>I need you to soften my heart
And break me apart
I need you to open my eyes
To see that You're shaping my life

All I am, I surrender

    <i>Give me faith
    To trust what you say
    That you're good
    And your love is great
    I'm broken inside
    I give you my life</i>

I need you to soften my heart
And break me apart
I need you to pierce through the dark
And cleanse every part of me

All I am, I surrender

    <i>I may be weak
    Your spirit's strong in me
    My flesh may fail
    My God You never will
    </i>
    </p>
